# Sprite-Kit-CoreMotion

This is the University Project for learning spritKit and CoreMotion.

I Created WestLand game demo that covers most of the spriteKit Classes. In this game player can shoot at enemy and controls are based on motion. You can use tilt to go left or right.




This is just a demo project for learning purpose.
